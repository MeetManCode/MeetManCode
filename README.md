- 👋 Hi, I’m @MeetManCode
- 👀 I’m passionate about blending electrical engineering and software development, with a focus on areas like microcontroller programming, embedded systems, robotics automation, and IoT (Internet of Things). I also enjoy exploring renewable energy systems, circuit design, and machine learning applications in robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing Computer Science in Engineering at TUHH (Hamburg University of Technology).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that combine hardware and software, especially in robotics, automation, and smart devices.
- 📫 How to reach me: [manmeet.singh2002@icloud.com]
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m fascinated by how small-scale projects, like DIY robots, can be scaled into real-world solutions!
